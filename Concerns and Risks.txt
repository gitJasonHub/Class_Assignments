Risks we have identified in regards to our team project:

Saving files: Dr. Google

Learning UI:  Ask Dr. Google

Creating a DataBase: Consult with Dr. Google
On the internet I see hundreds of people creating Databases on Android apps with SQLite. So it is a very common thing to do. 
If all else fails we could create our own database as a struct. Thus we do not need a database. However it may be easier to use one.
