Risks we have identified in regards to our team project:

Saving files: Dr. Google
It turns out that in java we can write objects to a file.  
To do this we use the FileOutputStream and the ObjectOutputStream objects.  
The FileOutputStream object opens an existing file or creates a new one if not found.
The ObjectOutputStream object allows us to write an object to the file
You call the writeObject function within ObjectOutputStream with a object as a parameter. 
After that you simply close the file calling the close function of the ObjectOutputStream.
To retrieve the files you simply do the reverse with a FileInputStream and a ObjectInputStream.
FileInputStream opens the file where the object(s) are stored.
Then the ObjectInputStream allows you assign a new object to the object in the file.
The ObjectInputStream returns a generic object so you have to cast it to get it to be what you want.  
Once you get the objects you want you simply close the file. 

Learning UI:  Ask Dr. Google

Creating a DataBase: Consult with Dr. Google
	On the internet I see hundreds of people creating Databases on Android apps with SQLite. This software comes with Android since version ("cupcake"). So it is a very common thing to do. If all else fails we could create our own database as a struct. Which we can save as a .txt file. Thus we do not need a database. However it may be easier to use one.
